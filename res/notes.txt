all machine learning is classification
most time in ML:
1. Acquiring Data
2. Organizing & Structured Data (typically structured terribly in raw form)
* Even for unsupervised learning, you might want to normalize data to improve chances for success.
Unsupervised learning: take anything and give to machine and return awesome insights (really difficult).

Support Vector Machine
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.

Good statistic to analyze: Debt/Equity

If want to invest: 
1. Trailing P/E - 12 is generally average. Higher for Tech since most of its value is intangible. Better than Forward P/E since it is projected. 
2. Price/Book - Worth x times more than its book value (if it sold everything on its books). Higher for Tech companies. Non-Tech have values closer to 0 because they don't have much more than their inventory (i.e. dedicated consumers, technology innovations, etc.). 
3. Debt/Equity- Debt is 31 times their equity (tech)

(1) Exclusively look at Debt/Equity
	-> Higher = More Leveraged
	-> Tech companies have a lot of debt and little equity
	-> Eventually want to measure all kinds of things and put in different sectors
	-> ideal normalization: scale -1 to 1 for each type of company


Pandas: Manipulation of dataset. Good for spreadsheet or database type manipulation.

Python os module can be used to perform tasks such as finding the name of present working directory, changing current working directory, checking if certain files or directories exist at a location, creating new directories, deleting existing files or directories, walking through a directory and performing operations on every file in the directory that satisfies some user-defined criteria, and a lot more.
