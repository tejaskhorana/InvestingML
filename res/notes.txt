all machine learning is classification
most time in ML:
1. Acquiring Data
2. Organizing & Structured Data (typically structured terribly in raw form)
* Even for unsupervised learning, you might want to normalize data to improve chances for success.
Unsupervised learning: take anything and give to machine and return awesome insights (really difficult).

Support Vector Machine
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.
